The main file used in this program at this time is pimTimeEnergyCompute.py which is a work in progress

Currently it can take a workloads layer and compute time, energy, avg power, and power consumptio and plots it in a data table which is then pasteable for ease of plotting on excel document.

Workload.csv hold the layers, weights, and MACS so that the python file can read through and compute the results as mentioned above for each layer within the csv and it is plotted on a data table as mentioned above.
